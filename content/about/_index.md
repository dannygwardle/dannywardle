I am currently a PhD candidate at the Australian Catholic University's [Dianoia Institute of Philosophy](https://www.acu.edu.au/research/our-research-institutes/dianoia-institute-of-philosophy) in Melbourne. Previously, I completed a Master of Philosophy degree at the [University of Adelaide](https://arts.adelaide.edu.au/humanities/department-of-philosophy). My MPhil thesis consisted of three papers discussing perdurantist theories of persistence. Before that, I completed a Bachelor of Arts (Advanced) at Adelaide.

I am an Ordinary Member of the [Australasian Association of Philosophy Postgraduate Committee](https://aap.org.au/postgraduates). In 2020, I was the Convenor of that committee.

I am interested in analytic metaphysics, broadly speaking. I am particularly interested in topics at the intersection of metaphysics, philosophy of physics, and philosophy of language. I am currently working on preparing some of my MPhil work for publication.
